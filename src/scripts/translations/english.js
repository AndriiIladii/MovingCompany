I was especially worried about my glass table and mirrors, but everything arrived safe and sound. Total professionalism and great communication. Thanks for a stress-free day!",
  secondReview:
    "A very professional team. They arrived perfectly on time, which was key for me. All furniture was carefully wrapped in film and blankets, so nothing got scratched during transport. The guys worked fast but without rushing. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable company in Warsaw!",

    "Working with this company was a pure pleasure. We needed to move a very heavy wardrobe and a piano up to the fourth floor with no elevator. The guys handled it without a single complaint! I'm impressed by their strength and technique. Everything was secured with straps, zero damage in the stairwell. Super job.",
  seventhReview:

The price was exactly as agreed over the phone, with no extra charges. A pleasure dealing with such professionals. Recommended!",

    "This is my second move with Vitolio, and once again, I wasn't disappointed. The service was top-notch. The guys didn't just move things; they also helped disassemble and reassemble a large sliding wardrobe. It stands stable and straight. Fully recommended!",
